  abstract = {Abstract Deep mutational scanning can provide significant insights into the function of essential genes in bacteria. Here, we developed a high-throughput method for mutating essential genes of Escherichia coli in their native genetic context. We used Cas9-mediated recombineering to introduce a library of mutations, created by error-prone PCR, within a gene fragment on the genome using a single gRNA pre-validated for high efficiency. Tracking mutation frequency through deep sequencing revealed biases in the position and the number of the introduced mutations. We overcame these biases by increasing the homology arm length and blocking mismatch repair to achieve a mutation efficiency of 85\% for non-essential genes and 55\% for essential genes. These experiments also improved our understanding of poorly characterized recombineering process using dsDNA donors with single nucleotide changes. Finally, we applied our technology to target rpoB, the beta subunit of RNA polymerase, to study resistance against rifampicin. In a single experiment, we validate multiple biochemical and clinical observations made in the previous decades and provide insights into resistance compensation with the study of double mutants.},

We tested each mutation for plasticity and epistasis by comparing its fitness effects across these ecological and genetic contexts. Some mutations had no measurable effect in any of these contexts. None of the mutations had effects on phenotypic plasticity that were independent of genetic background. However, half the mutations had epistatic interactions such that their effects differed among genetic backgrounds, usually in an environment-dependent manner. Also, the pattern of mutational effects across backgrounds indicated that epistasis had been shaped primarily by unique events in the evolutionary history of a population rather than by repeatable events associated with shared environmental history.},

	shorttitle = {Perspective},
	abstract = {Epistasis for fitness means that the selective effect of a mutation is conditional on the genetic background in which it appears. Although epistasis is widely observed in nature, our understanding of its consequences for evolution by natural selection remains incomplete. In particular, much attention focuses only on its influence on the instantaneous rate of changes in frequency of selected alleles via epistatic contribution to the additive genetic variance for fitness. Thus, in this framework epistasis only has evolutionary importance if the interacting loci are simultaneously segregating in the population. However, the selective accessibility of mutational trajectories to high fitness genotypes may depend on the genetic background in which novel mutations appear, and this effect is independent of population polymorphism at other loci. Here we explore this second influence of epistasis on evolution by natural selection. We show that it is the consequence of a particular form of epistasis, which we designate sign epistasis. Sign epistasis means that the sign of the fitness effect of a mutation is under epistatic control; thus, such a mutation is beneficial on some genetic backgrounds and deleterious on others. Recent experimental innovations in microbial systems now permit assessment of the fitness effects of individual mutations on multiple genetic backgrounds. We review this literature and identify many examples of sign epistasis, and we suggest that the implications of these results may generalize to other organisms. These theoretical and empirical considerations imply that strong genetic constraint on the selective accessibility of trajectories to high fitness genotypes may exist and suggest specific areas of investigation for future research.},
